# Gemini CLI Information

This document provides helpful information for the Gemini CLI about the structure of this website.

## Blog Posts

Blog posts for this website are located in the `_posts` folder. Each blog post is a separate file in Markdown format.

The name of each blog post file must start with the date, followed by a dash, then the title of the post, and finally the `.md` extension. For example: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`.

Each blog post file also needs a section at the very top, enclosed by `---` lines, where you can define details like the title, author, and date for the website to use. This is called "Front Matter".

## Blog Post Images

Images for blog posts should be placed in the `img/posts/` directory.

To keep things organized, create a new subfolder inside `img/posts/` for each blog post. The name of this subfolder should match the date and title part of your blog post file.

For example, if your blog post file is `2025-12-18-my-new-blog-post.md`, you would create a folder named `2025-12-18-my-new-blog-post` inside `img/posts/`. All images for that specific blog post would then go into this new folder.

When you use an image in your blog post, you would link to it like this: `/img/posts/2025-12-18-my-new-blog-post/your-image-name.jpg`.
