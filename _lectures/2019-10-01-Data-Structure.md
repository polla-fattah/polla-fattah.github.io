## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms essential for software engineering. Students will learn to design, implement, and analyze various data structures using C++ programming language. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and elegant code design.

The curriculum covers essential data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, along with fundamental algorithms for searching and sorting. Students will develop a deep understanding of time and space complexity analysis using Big O notation, enabling them to make informed decisions about algorithm selection for different problem scenarios.

Through hands-on programming assignments and projects, students will gain practical experience in implementing these data structures and algorithms, preparing them for advanced computer science courses and real-world software development challenges.
