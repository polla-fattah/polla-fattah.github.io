## Course Description

This course provides an in-depth examination of the principles, design, and implementation of distributed database systems (DDBS). It covers essential concepts such as distributed data storage, query processing, transaction management, concurrency control, replication, reliability, and scalability in a distributed environment.

## Prerequisites

- Database Systems (or equivalent)

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts, advantages, and challenges of distributed database systems.
- Analyze different DDBS architectures and their suitability for various applications.
- Design distributed databases, including fragmentation, replication, and allocation strategies.
- Implement and optimize query processing techniques in a distributed environment.
- Apply transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to ensure data consistency.
- Design and implement replication strategies for availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
- Evaluate reliability techniques for distributed databases.
- Explore current trends and research directions in distributed database systems.
