## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), focusing on the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. Students will learn the fundamental principles of user interface design, usability engineering, and human factors in computing.

The curriculum covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications of HCI, including user research methods, interface design principles, interaction techniques, and evaluation methodologies. Students will gain hands-on experience in designing and evaluating user interfaces for various platforms and applications.

Through projects and case studies, students will develop the skills necessary to create user-centered designs that are both functional and accessible, preparing them for careers in user experience design, software development, and human-computer interaction research.

## Prerequisites

- Programming Fundamentals
- Basic psychology and cognitive science concepts
- Understanding of software development processes
- Visual design principles (recommended)
- Statistics and research methods (recommended)

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand fundamental HCI principles and human factors in computing.
- Apply user-centered design methodologies and usability engineering practices.
- Design and evaluate user interfaces for various platforms and applications.
- Conduct user research and usability testing effectively.
- Implement accessibility and universal design principles.
- Analyze and improve interface usability through iterative design processes.
- Understand the societal and individual impact of user interface design.
