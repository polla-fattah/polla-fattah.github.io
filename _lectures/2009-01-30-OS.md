## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to operating system principles, design, and implementation using MINIX as a practical example. Students will explore the fundamental concepts that underlie modern operating systems, including process management, memory management, file systems, and I/O operations.

The curriculum covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementation aspects, enabling students to understand how operating systems manage hardware resources and provide services to application programs. Through hands-on experience with MINIX, students will gain insight into real operating system internals and learn how theoretical concepts translate into actual system code.

This course is essential for students pursuing careers in systems programming, embedded systems, or any field requiring deep understanding of computer system architecture and resource management.

## Prerequisites

- Computer Architecture fundamentals
- Programming in C (or equivalent)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Assembly language basics (recommended)

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental principles and components of operating systems.
