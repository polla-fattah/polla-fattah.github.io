## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to database management systems, focusing on relational databases and MySQL as the primary implementation platform. Students will learn fundamental database concepts, design principles, and practical implementation techniques essential for modern software development.

The curriculum covers database design methodologies, including Entity-Relationship modeling and normalization, as well as practical skills in SQL programming and database administration. Students will gain hands-on experience with MySQL, learning to create, manage, and query databases effectively.

Through projects and practical exercises, students will develop the skills necessary to design and implement database solutions for real-world applications, preparing them for careers in software development, data analysis, and database administration.

## Prerequisites

- Programming Fundamentals
- Basic mathematics and logic
- Understanding of data structures
- Familiarity with computer systems
- No prior database experience required

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand fundamental database concepts and relational database theory.
- Gather and analyze database requirements effectively.
- Design databases using Entity-Relationship modeling techniques.
- Apply normalization principles to create efficient database schemas.
- Implement databases using SQL and MySQL.
- Perform data manipulation operations (insert, update, delete).
- Write complex queries to retrieve and analyze data.
