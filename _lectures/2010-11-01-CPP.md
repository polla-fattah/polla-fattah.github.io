## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming fundamentals using C++ as the primary language. Designed specifically for electrical engineering students, the course emphasizes the importance of programming skills in solving real-world engineering problems, particularly in real-time systems and embedded applications.

The curriculum covers essential programming concepts including algorithms, data structures, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming principles. Students will learn to design, implement, and debug C++ programs while understanding the theoretical foundations that underlie programming languages and software development.

Through hands-on projects and practical exercises, students will develop the programming skills necessary for electrical engineering applications, including microcontroller programming, signal processing, and system control.

## Prerequisites
