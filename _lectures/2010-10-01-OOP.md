## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), one of the most important methodologies in modern software development. Students will learn the fundamental principles and concepts of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

The curriculum emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, enabling students to design and develop software using object-oriented principles. Through hands-on programming projects and exercises, students will gain experience in applying OOP concepts to solve real-world programming problems.

This course serves as a foundation for advanced software engineering courses and prepares students for professional software development careers where OOP is the dominant programming paradigm.

## Prerequisites

- Programming Fundamentals (or equivalent)
- Basic programming concepts and logic
- Familiarity with at least one programming language
- Understanding of data types and control structures

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.
- Design and implement classes and objects with proper encapsulation.
- Utilize inheritance to create class hierarchies and promote code reuse.
- Implement polymorphism through method overriding and overloading.
- Apply abstraction and interfaces for flexible software design.
- Handle exceptions and errors using proper exception handling mechanisms.
- Use generics and templates for type-safe programming.
- Design and implement object-oriented software solutions.
