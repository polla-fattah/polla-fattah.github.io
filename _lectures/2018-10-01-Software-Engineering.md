## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to software engineering principles, methodologies, and practices. Software engineering is the systematic approach to developing, operating, and maintaining software systems, transforming coding activities into manageable, repeatable processes that can be effectively managed and transferred between development teams.

The curriculum covers the entire software development lifecycle, from initial requirements analysis through design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Students will learn various software development methodologies, design patterns, and best practices that enable the creation of high-quality, maintainable software systems.

Through case studies, group projects, and hands-on exercises, students will gain practical experience in applying software engineering principles to real-world development scenarios, preparing them for professional software development careers.
