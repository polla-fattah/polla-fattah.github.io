## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to distributed systems, covering fundamental design principles, communication mechanisms, and implementation challenges. Students will learn how to design and implement distributed applications that can operate across multiple networked computers while maintaining reliability, performance, and consistency.

The curriculum covers essential distributed systems concepts including communication protocols, synchronization mechanisms, fault tolerance, and distributed algorithms. Students will gain hands-on experience with Java programming for distributed applications, including multithreading, network programming, and Remote Method Invocation (RMI).

Through practical projects and case studies, students will develop the skills necessary to design, implement, and troubleshoot distributed systems, preparing them for careers in cloud computing, distributed software development, and system architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Programming Fundamentals (Java preferred)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Computer Networks fundamentals
