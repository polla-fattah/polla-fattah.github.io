## Course Description

I have curated this course from the traditional course that we had at the college but adapted it to fit more with software engineering. To do so I have included multiple topics from the book nature of code. The course intended to teach the theoretical and practical level of how to implement mathematics into the software engineering.

## Course Objectives

At the end of the course, students will be able to understand the mathematical concepts of calculus,  
Calculus, Fourier Transform, Random Variables, Simulating Physical Systems, flock behavior, autonomous agents.

## Course Content

- Derivatives
- Integration
- Matrix
- vector
- generating random numbers
- simulating gravitational systems
- Simulating Wind forces
- Simulating autonomous tracking
- Steering and Arrival
- Flock Behavior
