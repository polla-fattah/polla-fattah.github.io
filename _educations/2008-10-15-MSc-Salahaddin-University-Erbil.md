## Salahaddin University-Erbil

[Salahaddin University-Erbil](http://su.edu.krd/) is one of the public higher education institution in the North of Iraq and especially in Kurdistan region. It is located in Erbil (Hewler), capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Sulaimani University-Sulaimani was established in 1968. It was moved to Erbil in 1981 and changed its name to Salaheddin university. Initially, the university included seven Academic Colleges: Science, Agriculture, Engineering, Administration, Arts, Education, and Medicine. In 1985, a college of Law and Politics was added, followed by the college of Dentistry in 1995. Several more were established in the following years so that by 2004, the university offered courses in 22 departments. In 2005, the departments of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, and Pharmacy split from Salahaddin University to establish Hawler Medical University.

## Electrical Engineering Dept

[Electrical Engineering Dept](http://colleges.su.edu.krd/engineering/electrical-engineering-department/about/) is one of the oldest department of the College of Engineering at Salahddin University-Erbil. The faculty members are dedicated scholars committed to the advancement of knowledge. They are also dedicated lecturers of undergraduate and graduate students.

## Subjects that I have Learned

Masters Degree in Sahandin University-Erbil is a two year study first year is mainly theoritic and second year is research work. I have learned many subjects in this course including:

- Advanced Engineering Mathematics.
- Data Modeling.
- Data Communication and Networking.
- Artificial Neural Networks.
- Computer Organization and Architecture.
- Digital Signal Processing.
- Data Networking.
- Radiation and Propagation.
- Digital Communication.

## Algorithms

In the process of my masters degree, I have learned many algorithms and algorithms are used in many fields. I have studied Apriori algorithm for Association Rule Mining and proposed a modified version of Apriori algorithm for frequent and infrequent itemset Mining. The code of the algorithm is available in [Modified Apriori](https://github.com/polla-fattah/Associasion-mining-variation){:target="masterCode"}

## My Thesis

You can find the MS OfficeWord version of my Thesis in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/polla-fattah/Thesis){:target="Thesis"}, with a compiled [PDF version](https://github.com/polla-fattah/Thesis/blob/main/thesis.pdf){:target="DissertationPDF"}. And the defense presentation is available [here](https://github.com/polla-fattah/Thesis/blob/main/defense%20Seminar.ppt){:target="presentation"}.
