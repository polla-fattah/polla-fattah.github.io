    <p>
      In my career, I primarily see myself as a problem solver, which is reflected in both my professional and academic
      pursuits.
      More details about my career can be found on other parts of this website.
      <br>
      However, this page is dedicated to highlighting my personal traits and interests outside of my professional life.
      Despite my love for solving problems, there is much more to me than just my career and I hope to showcase that
      here.

  <h1 class="contact-header">My Hobbies</h1>

  <p>
    Given the nature of my work and my lifestyle, I can be considered a bit of a geek.
    This characteristic also extends to my hobbies. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, reading books, and watching
    movies, TV shows, and YouTube videos.
    These activities are a great source of relaxation and allow me to engage with my interests on a deeper level.

<h1 class="contact-header">My Habits</h1>
<p>
  I have a few notable habits that make me who I am. Firstly, my love for tea is well-known among those who know me. My
  relationship with tea could be described as addictive, but it serves as a positive trade-off for me. When I spend long
  hours working on the computer, drinking tea helps me stay alert and hydrated.
</p>
<p>
  Another habit that I have is my preference for walking while thinking. This is a habit that I find particularly
  helpful for clearing my mind and making decisions. Even during meetings, I often find an excuse to take a brief walk
  to contemplate before making a decision.
</p>
<p> 
  These habits, especially my love for tea and walking, are an integral part of my daily routine and have become a
  defining aspect of who I am.

  <h1 class="contact-header">My Life's Timeline</h1>
  <p>
    Anybody who know me a little bit, they know that I really enjoy drinking tea.
    My habit with tea can be described as addictive, But I think it is a very good
    trade from me while I am working on computer for prolonged time it keeps me a
    bit alerted and hydrated. Another habit that I have, I really love walking while
    I am thinking, even when people are seated in meetings I tend to find an excuse
    to have a small stroll before making my mind.
