# Kurdistan Universities Chess Championship

Today was a great day for me and my colleagues at **Salahaddin University-Erbil**. We took part in the first **Kurdistan Universities Chess Championship**, and I'm happy to share that our team won! **Prof. Dr. Hawre Mustafa Bakr**, President of Erbil Medical University, supervised the event, which was organized by the Sports Activities Directorate together with the [Khanzad Chess Club](https://www.khanzadchessclub.com/Default.aspx?l=1). The tournament used the Swiss system in team format.

## The Swiss System Format

The tournament used the **Swiss system**, which pairs players with similar scores throughout the tournament. This made it fair for everyone. As a team, we had to work together and support each other, and I think we did a good job coordinating our efforts.

## The Khanzad Chess Club

The [Khanzad Chess Club](https://www.khanzadchessclub.com/Default.aspx?l=1) was a great place to hold the tournament. They have hosted many chess tournaments before, including the **Barzani International Chess Championship** and the **Khanzad International Rapid Chess Tournament**, so they know how to organize these events well.

## What This Victory Means to Me

This tournament was more than just playing chess—it was a chance for universities across Kurdistan to come together. For me personally, winning with my colleagues Dr. Farhad Ali, Dr. Shwan Othman, and Mr. Hazhar Jalal was really nice. The event helped:

- Bring universities together for friendly competition
- Let people from different universities meet and talk
- Show that chess can be a good activity for university staff
- Build connections between Kurdistan's universities
