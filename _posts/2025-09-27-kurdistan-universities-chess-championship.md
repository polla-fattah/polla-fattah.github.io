# Kurdistan Universities Chess Championship

Today was a great day for me and my colleagues at **Salahaddin University-Erbil**. We took part in the first **Kurdistan Universities Chess Championship**, and I'm happy to share that our team won! **Prof. Dr. Hawre Mustafa Bakr**, President of Erbil Medical University, supervised the event, which was organized by the Sports Activities Directorate together with the [Khanzad Chess Club](https://www.khanzadchessclub.com/Default.aspx?l=1). The tournament used a team match format where each team consisted of four players, and the total wins from all four players counted for each round.

## Our Team

The tournament was held at the **Khanzad Chess Club** hall over five rounds. I was part of the **Salahaddin University-Erbil** team with my colleagues:

1. **Dr. Farhad Ali**
2. **Dr. Shwan Othman** 
3. **Dr. Polla Fattah** (me)
4. **Mr. Hazhar Jalal**

The tournament brought together university lecturers and staff from across Kurdistan who like to play chess. It was a good chance to meet people from other universities and have some friendly competition.

### Participating Universities

Eight universities from across Kurdistan took part:

1. **[Salahaddin University-Erbil](https://univsul.edu.iq)** - *Winner*

## During the Games

The tournament used a **team match format**, where each team fielded four players against another team's four players. The team with the most individual wins in each match would win that round. This format required us to work together as a team and support each other, and I think we did a good job coordinating our efforts.
