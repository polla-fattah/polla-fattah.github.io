### Looking Forward

This Lagal Ranj discussion represents a crucial step in raising awareness about AI's impact on Kurdistan. The panel highlighted both the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead as we navigate this technological transformation. Key takeaways include the urgent need to preserve and digitize Kurdish language resources, prepare our workforce for AI-driven changes, and ensure our educational institutions adapt to this new reality.

As we move forward, it's essential that Kurdistan develops a strategic approach to AI adoption - one that leverages these technologies for regional development while preserving our cultural identity and addressing security concerns. Through continued dialogue, education, and collaborative efforts between academia, industry, and government, we can position Kurdistan to benefit from the AI revolution while maintaining our unique cultural heritage.
