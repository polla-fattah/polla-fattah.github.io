I participated in a comprehensive live discussion on Rudaw TV's "Lagal Ranj" program on October 13, 2024, focusing on artificial intelligence and its specific implications for Kurdistan. This was an extensive panel discussion with leading experts from academia and industry, exploring how AI technologies like ChatGPT will fundamentally transform our region's language, employment landscape, security considerations, and cultural preservation.

### Defining Artificial Intelligence in Kurdish Context

During the program, one of the university professors defined artificial intelligence as "gathering all the intelligence of the world into one device and delivering it to humans in the shortest possible time." This definition sparked an important debate about whether AI can truly think like humans at this stage, with the consensus being that "this remains a topic of discussion."

### Key Discussion Points and Expert Insights

The panel covered several crucial topics with deep analysis:

#### **AI Regulation and Governance**
A critical question emerged: Can laws and regulations be established for artificial intelligence? The expert consensus was clear - "No, because AI development is much faster than laws can be created." This highlights the challenge facing policymakers worldwide, but particularly in regions like Kurdistan where technological adaptation must be swift.

#### **Employment Transformation**
While there are legitimate concerns about job displacement due to AI, the panel presented a balanced perspective. Yes, some current jobs will be lost to AI automation, but simultaneously, "AI might discover several new jobs for us that we haven't even thought about today." This dual nature of technological disruption was a central theme.

#### **Kurdistan's Strategic Response**
For Kurds as a stateless nation, the question of how to effectively engage with AI for present and future benefit was paramount. The panel noted that "good work has already begun at the individual and university level," with specific mention that "the University of Kurdistan has made a good start in working on artificial intelligence."

#### **Kurdish Language and Digital Preservation**
One of the most pressing issues discussed was the absence of Kurdish language and its various dialects within AI systems. The panel emphasized the critical need to digitize Kurdish libraries and literature. This is not just about technological inclusion - it's about cultural survival. **Some Kurdish dialects face the risk of disappearing entirely if they are not properly documented and integrated into digital systems.**

#### **Cybersecurity and AI Ethics**
A university student raised concerns about AI being used for cybercrime. The expert response was pragmatic: "Anything that AI can break, can also be fixed by AI." This highlighted the dual-edged nature of AI technology in security contexts.

#### **Educational Imperatives**
An AI expert made a crucial appeal to parents: "For the good of their children's future, they should teach their children coding from now." This underscores the urgency of preparing the next generation for an AI-driven world.

### Distinguished Panel of Experts

This comprehensive discussion brought together leading voices in AI and technology from across Kurdistan:

- **Dr. Polla Fattah** - AI Researcher and Professor at Salahaddin University
- **Dr. Abdulbast Kamal** - Software Engineering Professor at University of Koya
- **Yahya Lazgin Chali** - CEO of an AI Technology Company
- **Evin Qadir** - Owner of a Digital Technology Company
- **Abdulhadi Rwandzi** - Professor at University of Kurdistan-Erbil and AI Master's Degree Holder
- **Ara Miran** - Professor at British International University in Erbil

This diverse panel represented the full spectrum of AI expertise in Kurdistan, from academic research to practical industry applications.

### Critical Challenges and Opportunities

The discussion revealed several critical insights, as also documented in the Kurdish media coverage:

**Language Endangerment**: Beyond the technical challenges of AI integration, the panel highlighted a cultural crisis. **Kurdish dialects are at risk of disappearing entirely** if not properly documented and digitized. As emphasized in the discussion, "Kurdish libraries must be digitized". This represents more than technological inclusion—it's about cultural survival in the digital age.

**Educational Revolution**: The unanimous call for coding education from childhood reflects the urgency of preparing Kurdistan's youth for an AI-dominated future. As one AI expert emphasized during the program, parents should "teach their children coding from now" for the benefit of their children's future. This represents an essential requirement for economic competitiveness, not an optional enhancement.

**Regulatory Vacuum**: The acknowledgment that AI development outpaces legal frameworks presents both challenges and opportunities for Kurdistan to develop innovative governance approaches. As noted in the discussion, "AI development is much faster than laws can be established". This regulatory gap creates unique opportunities for Kurdistan to pioneer adaptive governance models.

**Cybersecurity Perspective**: Addressing student concerns about AI being used for cybercrime, the expert response was pragmatic: "Anything that AI can break, can also be fixed by AI". This perspective highlights the dual-edged nature of AI technology in security contexts.

### Looking Forward: Kurdistan's AI Strategy

This Lagal Ranj discussion represents more than academic discourse—it constitutes a strategic call to action for Kurdistan's technological future. The panel identified several immediate priorities:

1. **Urgent digitization** of Kurdish literature and linguistic resources
2. **Educational reform** integrating coding and AI literacy from elementary levels
3. **University-industry collaboration** to accelerate AI research and development
4. **Cultural preservation** through technological innovation
5. **Workforce preparation** for AI-driven economic transformation

The consensus emerged clearly: Kurdistan cannot afford to remain passive observers of the AI revolution. As a stateless nation, technological advancement becomes even more critical for cultural preservation and economic development. The expertise exists within Kurdistan's academic and business communities—what's required now is coordinated action and strategic investment.

Through continued dialogue exemplified by this Lagal Ranj discussion, Kurdistan can position itself not merely to adapt to AI technologies, but to contribute meaningfully to their development while preserving the rich cultural heritage that defines Kurdish identity.
