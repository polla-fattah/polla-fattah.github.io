I participated in a focused interview on Rudaw TV discussing the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential to revolutionize AI accessibility. This discussion came at the height of the DeepSeek hype, exploring how this new model could democratize AI research and development, particularly for researchers and institutions in developing regions.

### Key Discussion Points

During this insightful interview, we explored several important aspects of the AI landscape:

- **DeepSeek vs ChatGPT**: Technical and philosophical differences between the two AI models
- **Open Source Impact**: How DeepSeek's approach could break the monopoly of large tech companies
- **Research Democratization**: Making advanced AI accessible to individual researchers and smaller institutions
- **Third World Opportunities**: How developing countries can leverage open AI models for innovation
- **AI Speculation**: Addressing the hype cycle and realistic expectations for AI development
- **Future Implications**: The potential for more diverse and distributed AI development

### The Significance of Open AI Models

The emergence of DeepSeek represents a pivotal moment in AI development. Unlike proprietary models controlled by major corporations, open models like DeepSeek have the potential to:

- **Level the Playing Field**: Enable researchers worldwide to access state-of-the-art AI capabilities
- **Foster Innovation**: Allow for customization and adaptation to local needs and languages
- **Reduce Costs**: Eliminate expensive API fees and subscription models
- **Promote Transparency**: Enable better understanding of AI systems and their limitations
- **Encourage Collaboration**: Facilitate global research collaboration and knowledge sharing

### Looking Ahead

The discussion highlighted the transformative potential of open AI models for global research and development. As we move beyond the initial hype, it's crucial to focus on practical applications and real-world benefits. For regions like Kurdistan and other developing areas, open AI models represent an unprecedented opportunity to participate in the AI revolution without the barriers traditionally imposed by resource constraints.

This shift toward more accessible AI could fundamentally change how we approach technological development, making it more inclusive and globally distributed. The key is to move beyond speculation and focus on building practical applications that serve real needs in our communities.
