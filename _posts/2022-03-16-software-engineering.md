# Software Engineering Department

In the interview with the KTV [^1] I discussed the history, the mission, and the purpose of [Software Engineering Department](https://colleges.su.edu.krd/engineering/software-engineering-department/){:target="Software"} at [Salahaddin University-Erbil](https://su.edu.krd/){:target="Salahaddin"}. Dr. Ibrahim Hamarash established this department in 2000/2001 with 25 students. The first head of the department was Dr. Ibrahim himself with the founding teachers of the department were Dr. Shawbo, Mr. Karim, and Dr. Moaiad.

## Mission & Vision
The software engineering department's mission is to teach and prepare liberally educated, articulate, and skilled software engineers for leadership and professional careers and for advanced study. A central objective of our department program is to contribute to society by advancing the fields of software engineering through innovations in teaching and research thus enhancing student knowledge through interactive instruction, global engagement, and experiential learning, also the program will serve as a resource to inform society about innovations related to the production and uses of computers and software.[^2]

Graduates of the software engineering department will be recognized as innovative leaders in the field of software engineering by their work in software development in a myriad of application areas, and through their work in advanced study and research. The department will continue to be known for its passion for teaching these students and for their knowledge, expertise, and innovation in advancing the frontiers of knowledge in software engineering.[^2]

## Who can Apply

Then the discussion began about the skills and mindsets that are required from students so that they can successfully apply to this department and become productive self-sustaining and entrepreneurial members of their community. The qualities that are discussed were mainly about how they can map between their natural talents and different branches of software engineering in general. for example one of the quality was the love for art if a student has a love and passion for art then they might become successful UI/UX designers. 
We have also discussed students' desire for the discipline and how choosing this path out of passion will render a more successful and happier developer rather than choosing it out of the market calculation.

## Challenges

We also conversed about the problems with having many applicants and limited resources in the department which renders to rejecting many talented young developers. The solution for that might be the need for government support so that the department can open more labs and larger lecture rooms. As this can be considered a matter of national importance to have enough software engineers for the upcoming digital transformation plan of the KRG[^3].
