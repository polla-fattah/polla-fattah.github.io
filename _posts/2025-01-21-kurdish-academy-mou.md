January 21, 2025, marks a historic milestone in the journey of Kurdish language preservation and technological innovation. On this significant day, a **memorandum of understanding (MOU)** was signed between the University of Kurdistan Hewlêr's Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Centre (UKH-AIIC) and the Kurdish Academy, establishing a groundbreaking partnership that promises to revolutionize Kurdish language research and education.

## A Personal Journey: From Dream to Reality

This partnership represents the culmination of a vision that began during my PhD studies. Upon returning from the UK, I made multiple attempts to initiate AI research in the Kurdish language, reaching out to various institutions including the Kurdish Studies Department, the Department of Information Technology, previous Kurdish Academy staff, and former UKH deans. Each attempt was driven by the conviction that artificial intelligence could serve as a powerful tool for preserving and advancing our linguistic heritage. Today's MOU signing represents not just an institutional agreement, but the realization of a long-held dream to bridge cutting-edge technology with Kurdish cultural preservation.
