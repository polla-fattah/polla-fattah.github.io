On June 18, 2023, we embarked on an enriching cultural journey to Akre with our students from Salahaddin University-Erbil. This educational trip was designed to immerse our students in Kurdistan's rich historical heritage while fostering environmental consciousness and cultural appreciation.

## About Akre: A Historic Jewel

Akre is a breathtakingly beautiful historic town and one of the gems of Kurdistan <mcreference link="https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/13887-Ancient-sites-and-ecstatic-traditions:-Akre,-the-city-on-the-hillside" index="4">4</mcreference>. Built in the 7th century B.C., Akre is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akre" index="5">5</mcreference>. The city experienced its golden age under the Medes from 612 to 550 BC, and later came under Roman control in 115 AD when Emperor Trajan set up a victory statue in the city <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akre" index="5">5</mcreference>.

The town is a majestic blend of precipitous mountains, gushing rivers, crashing waterfalls, historic shrines, and gargantuan ruins <mcreference link="https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/13887-Ancient-sites-and-ecstatic-traditions:-Akre,-the-city-on-the-hillside" index="4">4</mcreference>. Akre consists of a historic old quarter tucked along the ridges and valleys, with growing new neighborhoods sprawling out downhill in the flatlands <mcreference link="https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/13887-Ancient-sites-and-ecstatic-traditions:-Akre,-the-city-on-the-hillside" index="4">4</mcreference>.

## A Day of Cultural Discovery

Our visit to Akre was more than just a sightseeing trip—it was a comprehensive cultural immersion experience. The students had the opportunity to explore historic sites and ancient castles that have stood as witnesses to centuries of Kurdish history. These old houses, superimposed on top of each other on the mountainside, are breathtakingly beautiful <mcreference link="https://spirit-travelers.com/en/visit-akre-iraqi-kurdistan/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

Akre was once a mixed city of Jews, Christians and Muslims, and today, besides Islam and the many mosques, you can still find some scattered churches because a Christian minority still resides there <mcreference link="https://spirit-travelers.com/en/visit-akre-iraqi-kurdistan/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Environmental Stewardship in Action

One of the most meaningful activities during our visit was the environmental cleanup initiative. Our students took it upon themselves to clean some historic places that had accumulated trash due to tourist activities. This hands-on environmental stewardship demonstrated our commitment to preserving Kurdistan's cultural heritage for future generations.

This activity aligned perfectly with our educational philosophy of combining academic learning with social responsibility. The students showed remarkable initiative and pride in maintaining the cleanliness and dignity of these historic sites.

## Educational Value and Cultural Significance

Akre is famous for having the largest Newroz celebration in all of Southern Kurdistan <mcreference link="https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/13887-Ancient-sites-and-ecstatic-traditions:-Akre,-the-city-on-the-hillside" index="4">4</mcreference>, making it a significant cultural center. The city is known for its celebrations of Newroz, and the best time to visit is in April since the climate is perfect and the Kurds celebrate the national day of Kurdistan on March 21, called "Newroz" <mcreference link="https://spirit-travelers.com/en/visit-akre-iraqi-kurdistan/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

For our students, this visit provided:
- **Historical Perspective**: Understanding the deep roots of Kurdish civilization
- **Cultural Appreciation**: Experiencing traditional Kurdish hospitality and customs
- **Environmental Awareness**: Participating in heritage preservation activities
- **Social Responsibility**: Contributing to community service through cleanup efforts

## A Collaborative Educational Experience

I was accompanied by my wife, who is also a lecturer at Salahaddin University-Erbil, making this a collaborative educational endeavor. Having multiple faculty perspectives enriched the learning experience for our students and demonstrated the university's commitment to comprehensive education that extends beyond classroom walls.

## Conclusion: Preserving Heritage for Future Generations

Our cultural day in Akre was a resounding success, combining historical exploration with environmental stewardship and cultural immersion. The students returned with a deeper appreciation for Kurdistan's rich heritage and a stronger sense of responsibility toward preserving it.

As we returned in the evening, the students carried with them not just memories of a beautiful historic town, but also a renewed connection to their cultural roots and an understanding of their role as guardians of Kurdistan's precious heritage.

This trip exemplified our university's commitment to holistic education—one that values cultural heritage, environmental responsibility, and active citizenship alongside academic excellence.
