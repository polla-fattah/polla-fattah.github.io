Recently, I had the opportunity to discuss the profound influence of Artificial Intelligence on education and society during a podcast with Kurdistan 24 [^1]. This platform allowed me to share my thoughts on several critical aspects of AI, from its role in the classroom to its broader implications for the future of humanity.

## Enhancing Learning with AI

The discussion began with an exploration of how AI can transform teaching and learning. I highlighted the potential of AI to make educational experiences more personalized and engaging, which can help students from various backgrounds succeed. However, I also stressed the importance of using AI to complement, not replace, the critical thinking skills of students. This balance is essential for harnessing AI as a tool for enhancement rather than dependency.

## AI and the Job Market

We then shifted our focus to the impact of AI on the job market, especially for graduates. I talked about the dual role of AI as both a creator of new opportunities and a disruptor of traditional jobs. To prepare students for this shifting landscape, I emphasized the necessity of integrating AI literacy into educational curricula, equipping students to not only adapt to but also shape the future workforce.

## AI’s Role in Research and Literature Review

Another significant point of our conversation was AI’s contribution to research and scholarly activities. I shared how AI tools have revolutionized the literature review process, enabling researchers to more efficiently analyze and synthesize vast amounts of information. Yet, I also cautioned about the ethical considerations that come with the use of AI in research, highlighting the need for responsibility in leveraging such powerful tools.

## The Future of Humanity and AI

As we concluded the interview, I reflected on the broader philosophical questions about the future of humanity in the age of AI advancements. To encourage a deeper understanding of these issues among our audience, I recommended "21 Lessons for the 21st Century" by Yuval Noah Harari. This book is an excellent resource for anyone interested in understanding how our current decisions will shape the future interactions between humans and AI.

This interview with Kurdistan 24 was a fantastic opportunity to discuss the transformative power of AI and its implications for education, the job market, research, and the ethical landscapes we navigate. It is my hope that these discussions will inspire thoughtful engagement and proactive strategies to use AI as a force for good in shaping a promising future.
