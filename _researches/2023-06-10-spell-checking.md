<p>Spell checking for Kurdish language addresses the critical need for accurate text correction tools that understand the unique orthographic and morphological characteristics of Kurdish writing systems.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Objectives</h2>

<p>This research aims to develop intelligent spell checking algorithms that can handle Kurdish script variations, morphological inflections, and dialectal differences.</p>

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kurdish morphological complexity</li>
<li>Multiple script systems (Latin, Arabic)</li>
<li>Dialectal variations in spelling</li>
<li>Context-sensitive error correction</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Methodology</h2>

<p>The approach combines statistical language models with rule-based morphological analysis to provide accurate and context-aware spell correction suggestions.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Current Work</h2>

<p><strong>Azhin</strong> is developing the core algorithms for error detection and correction, focusing on creating comprehensive dictionaries and morphological analyzers for Kurdish.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Expected Impact</h2>

<p>This tool will significantly improve Kurdish text quality in digital communications, educational materials, and publishing, supporting the preservation and development of Kurdish written culture.</p>
