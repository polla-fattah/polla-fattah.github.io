<p>Wishesazi (Word Creation) research focuses on developing systematic methodologies for creating new technical and scientific terminology in Kurdish language, addressing the growing need for modern vocabulary in academic and professional contexts.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Innovation</h2>

<p>This research introduces fuzzy logic approaches to automate and systematize the process of creating new Kurdish terms, ensuring linguistic consistency and cultural appropriateness.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fuzzy logic-based term generation</li>
<li>Morphological pattern analysis</li>
<li>Semantic field mapping</li>
<li>Cultural and linguistic validation</li>
<li>Automated quality assessment</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Technical Approach</h2>

<p>The system analyzes existing Kurdish vocabulary patterns and applies fuzzy logic rules to generate contextually appropriate new terms for emerging concepts in science and technology.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Current Development</h2>

<p><strong>Nida</strong> is developing the core algorithms for term generation and validation, creating comprehensive databases of Kurdish morphological patterns and semantic relationships.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Cultural Significance</h2>

<p>This work contributes to Kurdish language preservation and modernization, enabling the language to adapt to contemporary scientific and technological developments while maintaining its cultural authenticity.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Applications</h2>

<p>The research will benefit Kurdish education, scientific communication, and technical documentation, supporting the use of Kurdish in academic and professional environments.</p>
