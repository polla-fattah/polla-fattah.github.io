<p>Early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is crucial for timely intervention and improved outcomes. This research leverages machine learning techniques to analyze growth patterns and behavioral indicators for early ASD identification.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Methodology</h2>

<p>Our approach combines multiple data sources including developmental milestones, behavioral assessments, and growth metrics to create comprehensive predictive models.</p>

<h3>Key Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>Behavioral pattern analysis</li>
<li>Growth trajectory modeling</li>
<li>Machine learning classification algorithms</li>
<li>Early intervention recommendations</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Team</h2>

<p><strong>Aveen</strong> and <strong>Sizan</strong> are actively developing the machine learning models and validation frameworks for this important healthcare application.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Expected Impact</h2>

<p>This research aims to provide healthcare professionals with reliable tools for early ASD screening, potentially improving diagnosis accuracy and enabling earlier therapeutic interventions.</p>
