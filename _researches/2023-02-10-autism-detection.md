<h2 class="section-heading">Research Methodology</h2>

<p>Our approach combines multiple data sources including developmental milestones, behavioral assessments, and growth metrics to create comprehensive predictive models.</p>

<h3>Key Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>Behavioral pattern analysis</li>
<li>Growth trajectory modeling</li>
<li>Machine learning classification algorithms</li>
<li>Early intervention recommendations</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="section-heading">Expected Impact</h2>

<p>This research aims to provide healthcare professionals with reliable tools for early ASD screening, potentially improving diagnosis accuracy and enabling earlier therapeutic interventions.</p>
