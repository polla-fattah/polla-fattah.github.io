<p>Corpus development for Kurdish language involves creating large-scale, annotated text collections that serve as the foundation for various natural language processing applications and linguistic research.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Scope</h2>

<p>This project focuses on building comprehensive corpora that represent different Kurdish dialects, genres, and domains, providing essential resources for computational linguistics research.</p>

<h3>Corpus Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-dialectal text collections</li>
<li>Morphological annotations</li>
<li>Syntactic parsing data</li>
<li>Semantic role labeling</li>
<li>Named entity recognition datasets</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Data Collection</h2>

<p>The research involves systematic collection of Kurdish texts from various sources including literature, news, social media, and academic publications, ensuring balanced representation across domains.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Student Contribution</h2>

<p><strong>Fanar</strong> is leading the corpus annotation efforts, developing standardized guidelines for linguistic markup and quality assurance protocols.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Impact</h2>

<p>These corpora will enable advanced Kurdish NLP applications including machine translation, information retrieval, and language modeling, significantly advancing Kurdish computational linguistics.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Open Science</h2>

<p>The developed corpora will be made available to the research community, fostering collaborative development of Kurdish language technologies.</p>
