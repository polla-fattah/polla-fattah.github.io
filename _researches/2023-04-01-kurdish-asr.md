<p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Kurdish language focuses on developing advanced systems that can accurately convert spoken Kurdish into written text. This research addresses the unique phonetic characteristics and dialectal variations of Kurdish speech.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Objectives</h2>

<p>The primary goal is to create a robust ASR system that can handle various Kurdish dialects and accents, providing accurate transcription for both formal and conversational speech.</p>

<h3>Technical Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deep neural network architectures for acoustic modeling</li>
<li>Language model adaptation for Kurdish phonetics</li>
<li>Multi-dialect training datasets</li>
<li>Real-time speech processing capabilities</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="section-heading">Applications</h2>

<p>This research will enable various applications including voice assistants, transcription services, and accessibility tools for the Kurdish-speaking community.</p>
