<p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for Kurdish language aims to develop natural-sounding speech generation systems that can convert written Kurdish text into high-quality spoken audio.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research Focus</h2>

<p>This research addresses the unique phonetic and prosodic characteristics of Kurdish language to create authentic and intelligible speech synthesis.</p>

<h3>Technical Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Neural network-based speech synthesis</li>
<li>Kurdish phoneme modeling</li>
<li>Prosody and intonation patterns</li>
<li>Multi-speaker voice adaptation</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Current Progress</h2>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> is currently working on developing the core TTS architecture and training methodologies for Kurdish language synthesis.</p>
