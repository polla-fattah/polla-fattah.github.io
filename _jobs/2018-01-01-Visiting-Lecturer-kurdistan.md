## Acquired Experiences

More than experience this kind of visiting lecturer job expands my connections and networks of specialists in the field of computer science and software engineering.

## Why I Left

I have started working at [InfoRR Company](/job/software-consultant) which was a bit demanding job. So I just did not renew my contract as visiting lecturer.
