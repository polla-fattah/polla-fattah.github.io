## Job Duties

It was a one day visit to Koya University per week to teach Introduction to [Operating Systems](/academy/lecture/os/) course.

## Acquired Experiences

That was my first time I have teaching experience in another University so I have learned about the teaching process and regulations in another University.

## Why I Left

I had to travel to Germany for my Linux administration training grant. Then up on return I started a part time job as [Linux Administrator](/job/linux-administrator) at 7NetLayers Company.
