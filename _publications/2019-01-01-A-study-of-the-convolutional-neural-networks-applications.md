abstract: |
  At present, deep learning is widely used in a broad range of arenas. A convolutional neural networks (CNN) is becoming the star of deep learning as it gives the best and most precise results when cracking real-world problems. In this work, a brief description of the applications of CNNs in two areas will be presented; First, in computer vision, generally, that is, scene labeling, face recognition, action recognition, and image classification; Second, in natural language processing, that is, the fields of speech recognition and text classification.
