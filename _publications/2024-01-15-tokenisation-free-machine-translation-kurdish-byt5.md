abstract: |
  This paper presents a novel approach to Kurdish machine translation using tokenization-free methods with the ByT5 model. The research addresses the unique challenges of Kurdish language processing by implementing byte-level encoding that eliminates the need for traditional tokenization approaches. The study demonstrates improved translation quality and better handling of Kurdish morphological complexity through the use of ByT5 architecture.
