abstract: |
  This research explores domain adaptation techniques for Kurdish-English machine translation in low-resource settings. The study investigates methods to improve translation quality across different domains by leveraging transfer learning and domain-specific fine-tuning approaches. The work contributes to addressing the challenges of machine translation for under-resourced language pairs.
